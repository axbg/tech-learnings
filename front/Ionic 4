Ionic
    - a framework built on top of Apache Cordova that creates hybrid apps that run, mostly as a webview, on both Android and iOS
    - uses Angular by default, but can be used with both React & Vue 
    - comes with the powerfull Ionic CLI
    - comes with an on-device testing tool called Ionic DevApp (ionic serve -devapp)
    - project structure is very similar to Angular's
    - has an official UI library
    - has a preconfigured theme file in which colors & shades are declared
        - they can be applied using specific Ionic attributes (ex: color="dark" will reference "--ion-color-dark: #000000" from theme)
    - the metadata configuration file is "config.xml" and it's similar to Android's AndroidManifest.xml
