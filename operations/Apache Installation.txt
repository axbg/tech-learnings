->  if we have a problem with an application, we have to check the log of the app and identify the problem (in /var/log/) 

->  in var/log/messages are written informations about the OS session
->  in var/log/secure are written informations about ssh and other applications which require access
->  in var/log/yum.log are stored informations about the installed packages and their installation history

->  command "last" displays, in order, the last users connected to the machine (remotely or locally)

->  "cat /etc/passwd" - display the users of the local machine

->  "whereis <<name>>" - displays <<name>>'s location

->  alias <<new_command>>="<<command to be called>>"
			-> to permanently add an alias, it should be written in ~/.bashrc
			-> after editing ~/.bashrc, run it with . ~/.bashrc

Apache Configuring 

-> Install apache: "yum install httpd"

-> Important locations: - Module: /usr/lib64/httpd/modules *simlink: /etc/httpd/modules
						- Logs: /var/log/httpd 			   *simlink: /etc/httpd/logs
						- Config: /etc/httpd/conf

-> simlink comes from Symbolic Link and it's the same as the Windows' Shortcuts
-> hardlink are two files placed in different locations with different name which share the same memory space

-> to create a symlink: "ln -s <<home_location>> <<simlink_location>>"

-> start apache with "service httpd start" - but it wouldn't work because it's blocked by firewall

-> to flush rules on firewall use command "iptables -F"
			-> the rules will be rewritten at reboot

-> Install Lynx with command "yum install lynx"
-> Lynx is a text web browser

-> Acces /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	-> # comments a line

	-> Server Root: apache root location
	-> Listen: the port on which apache is listening
	-> Server Admin: e-mail address - doesn't have a sysadmin role


!!!!For security reasons, no installed application should run under the 'root' user!!!!

-> To start apache: - "systemctl start httpd" - systemctl is newer
					- "service httpd start"

-> To stop apache: - "systemctl stop httpd"
					- "service httpd stop"

-> To check apache status: - "systemctl status httpd"
					       - "service httpd status"

-> To start apache at boot use "systemctl enable httpd"
