Docker
    - Docker is a tool used to pack an environment inside a container
    - it's more lightweight than a VM because it will run as a process on the host OS
    - it uses yaml for images configuration
    - images are the template on which the containers are instantiated
    - docker images are stored in the cloud, in the Docker Hub
    
    - Commands
        - docker version - displays the version of the installed docker program
        - docker info - displays info about containers and images from the current machine

        - docker container run -it -p port:port <<image_name>> - run a container
                                                               - the -it flag runs the container interactively, in the foreground
                                                               - the -p flag is the short version of --publish
                                                               - local_machine_port:container_port

        - docker pull <<image_name>> - used to download an image from the docker Hub
                                     - images are automatically downloaded when a container is instantiated
        
        - docker container ls - displays the running containers
