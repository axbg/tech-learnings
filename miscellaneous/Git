Git Basics

	Local Repository

		- git help - displays all the available commands

		- git help *command* - displays informations about the specified command

		- git status - displays what has changed since the last commit

		- git init - initializes a new git repository

		- git add file - appends the current file to be added in the next commit
					   - it's added to the "staged" area

		- git add --all - appends all modified files to the next commit
		- git add *

		- git commit - creates a new commit

		- git commit -m "comentariu" - creates a new commit and a message to describe it

		- git log - displays the history of commits and informations about them

		- git log --oneline - does the same thing, but only with essential data

		- git checkout branch_name - switches to the specified branch

		- git checkout -b new_branch_name - creates a new branch and switches to it

		- git merge branch_to_be_merged - merges the current branch to the specified one

		- git merge branch1 branch2 - merges the second branch into the first one

		- git reset HEAD~nr - resets the last nr commits without removing the local files from hard disk

		- git reset --hard HEAD~nr - resets the last nr commits and deletes the local files from hard disk

		- git revert HEAD - reverts the last commit by creating a new commit that undoes everything that was done in the
								reverted commit 

		-git rebase branch - rebases the specified branch to the current one
			  - more info about rebase - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase

		-git cherry-pick commit_hash - creates a copy of the specified commit under the local position
								- it's a safer alternative to rebase
								- commits are reffered by their hashes (ex: d467740)

		- git commit --amend - appends the staged files to the last commit without creating a new one

		- git tag tag_name commit_name - creates a new tag under the specified position
									 - tags are used as references

		- git describe branch - displays the distance of the current branch from its last tag
		
		- git checkout . - removes the modifications from the unstaged files

		- git clean -f - removes the untracked files from the current location



	Remote Repository

		- git clone - clones a remote repository

		- git fetch - syncs the local and the remote repositories without altering the local one

		- git pull - syncs the local and the remote repositories and merges the remote repository into the local one

		- git pull --rebase - uses rebase instead of merge

		- git fakeTeamwork - simulates the creation of a new commit in the remote branch

		- git fakeTeamwork numebranch nr - simulates the creation of nr commits in the remote branch

		- git push - updates the remote repository, aplying the local commits that were newly created

		- git push repository_name branch_name - updates only a specific branch from a specific remote repository

		- git push origin branch1:branch2 - updates a remote branch using a local branch as reference

		- git push origin :branch - deletes the specified branch from the remote repository

		- git checkout -b local_branch upstream_branch - creates a new local branch and set its track to an upstream one

		- git branch -u remote_branch local_branch local - sets the track between an upstream branch and a local one
